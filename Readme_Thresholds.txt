The status recognition of the created app uses the following parameters for activity detection:

Not Moving < 6 km/h
6 km/h <= Running < 20 km/h + low frequency shaking
6 km/h <= Cycling < 40 km/h - shaking
40km/h <= Driving

The paces are chosen using experience, the frequencies for shake detection by try and error with part one of the app.
